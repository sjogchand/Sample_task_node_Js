                Like most website operators, Milenium Haus collects
                non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
                browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
                browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date
                and time of each visitor request when visitors use the Services.
                Milenium Haus’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
                information is to better understand how Milenium Haus’s visitors
                use the Services. From time to time, Milenium Haus may release
                non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.,
                by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Services
                and Milenium Haus may use aggregate information for any person
                without obligation. Milenium Haus also collects potentially
                personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                addresses and may collect statistics about the behavior of
                visitors to the Services. For instance, Milenium Haus may
                monitor the Services to help identify spam. We also may use
                these technologies to collect information about your online
                activities over time and across third-party websites or other
                online services (behavioral tracking).

                In addition to log data, we may also collect information about

                identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of

                legal bases set forth in the EU General Data Protection
                Regulation (GDPR) or EU Member State law. For example, our
                processing of Personal Data on individuals (as described above)
                is justified based on statutory provisions that (1) processing
                is based on the consent; (2) processing is necessary for
                Pacaso’s legitimate interests as set out herein; and (3)

                which you are a party. If you are in the EU or afforded
                protection under the GDPR, you may have certain rights with
                respect to the Personal Data. To the extent permitted by
                applicable data protection laws, you may access the Personal
                Data we hold about you; request that inaccurate, outdated, or no

                restricted; and, request that we provide your Personal Data in a
                format that allows you to transfer it to another service
                provider. You also may withdraw your consent at any time where
                we are relying on your consent for the processing of your
                Personal Data. You may object to our processing of your Personal
                Data where that processing is based on our legitimate interest.
