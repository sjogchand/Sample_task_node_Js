              <h3>1. Basic Terms</h3>
              <p class="my-3/4">
                Milenium Haus provides a marketplace that connects real estate
                buyers with the opportunity to purchase a portion or entirety of
                a property through a qualified LLC. The terms of any real estate
                purchases that are initiated on or learned about through the
                Services are provided in the real estate purchase agreement and
                related paperwork. Milenium Haus also provides property
                management services that are managed on the Milenium Haus mobile
                app and platform and governed by your subscription agreement to
                the Milenium Haus Property Management Services. Your use of the
                website and the mobile app are also subject to the terms of the
                Agreement. You are responsible for your use of the Services and
                for any consequences thereof. You may use the Services only if
                you can form a binding contract with Milenium Haus and are not a
                person barred from accessing the Services under the laws of the
                United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are under
                18 years of age you may not access or use the Services for any
                reason. Please contact us if you are aware that a person under
                18 is using the Services. You may use the Services only in
                compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state,
                national, and international laws, rules and regulations. None of
                the material or opportunities presented by, or available
                through, Milenium Haus, are intended to be offerings of, or
                solicitations of purchasers for, any fractional ownership
                interest in any jurisdiction where such an offering or
                solicitation would be prohibited or would require registration
                and/or regulatory approval. The Services are always evolving and
                the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time
                without prior notice to you. In addition, Milenium Haus may stop
                (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any
                features within the Services) to you or to users generally and
                may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain
                the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole
                discretion at any time without prior notice to you. The Services
                may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the content
                or information on the Services, queries made through the
                Services, or other information. The types and extent of
                advertising on the Services are subject to change. In
                consideration for Milenium Haus granting you access to and use
                of the Services, you agree that Milenium Haus, third-party
                providers and partners may place such advertising on the
                Services or in connection with the display of content or
                information from the Services whether submitted by you or
                others.

              <p class="my-3/4">
                Any information that you provide to Milenium Haus is subject to
                our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your
                information. You understand that through your use of the

                for storage, processing and use by Milenium Haus. As part of
                providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with
                certain communications, such as service announcements and
                administrative messages. These communications are considered
                part of the Services and your Milenium Haus account, which you
                may not be able to opt-out from receiving.

              <h3>3. Passwords</h3>
              <p class="my-3/4">
                You are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials

                actions under your account. We encourage you to use “strong”
                passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower
                case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account and with
                other accounts that you may connect to your Milenium Haus

                loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the
                above requirements. You agree to notify us immediately upon
                becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of
                your account. You may not use as a username the name of another
                person or entity or a name or trademark that is subject to any
                rights of another person without appropriate authorization. You
                may not use as a username any name that is offensive, vulgar or
                obscene.
