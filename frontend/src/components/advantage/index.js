                    <p> My Milenium Haus gives you a VIP home-buying advantage. Skip the line, and be the first to know about new listings eligible for the massive value increase of adding a Milenium Haus ADU. </p>
                    <p>     Modular Homes (ADUs) and co-ownership are the future of real estate. A limited number of eligible properties exist in urban markets, and trends show that institutional funds are scooping these up fast, so fast theyâ€™re buying entire neighborhoods before regular people have a chance to invest. My Milenium Haus gives you the exclusive opportunity to get these hot listings that most miss out on.
